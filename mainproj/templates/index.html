        <p>Nowadays, in the era of Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, there is no shortage of personal profile sites that can
        be found online.  At times, it seems as though an unending pestilence of them are mercilessly being spewed across the World Wide Web.
        In a poetic sort of irony, each profile is built by someone who, in a futile attempt to separate him/herself from the rest of the pack,
        ends up creating the same brand of content as everyone else.  A grim state of affairs indeed...</p>

        <p>This website, of course, will be no exception!!! </p>

        <p>It is my own attempt to cram one more self-congratulatory bio page into the Internet's already bloated warehouse
        of contrived personal profiles.  So feel free to look around at this site's <em>vast</em> array of content.
        There are literally dozens of lines worth of information!</p>

      <div class="intro">
        <p>
            This relatively (extremely) modest website was built by me from the ground up. It is the very first
            website I ever created, and it needs somewhat of a code overhaul.  However, at the moment I'm too busy
            pursuing other more interesting projects
            (<a href="http://bfolks2.pythonanywhere.com/">like this aviation site here</a>), as well as world domination,
            so this setup will have to suffice.
            <br></br>
            Over the last several years, I have been working as an engineer/developer for multiple companies of varying
            size. During this time, I have programmed in several languages for an array of applications
            (see the <a href="{% url 'mainapp:documents' %}">Resume</a> and <a href="{% url 'mainapp:list' %}">About Me</a>
            sections for more details).  My software development experience is primarily back-end Python and VB.NET, but
            as an excuse to add a touch of frontend JavaScript to this site, I created the random "Inspirational Quote
            Generator" you can see below.  Enjoy!
