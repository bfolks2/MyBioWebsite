      <p>About the Site</p>
    </div>

    <div class="intro">

      <p>Nowadays, in the era of Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, there is no shortage of personal profile sites that can
      be found online.  At times, it seems as though an unending pestilence of them are mercilessly being spewed across the World Wide Web.
      In a poetic sort of irony, each profile is built by someone who, in a futile attempt to separate him/herself from the rest of the pack,
      ends up creating the same brand of content as everyone else.  A grim state of affairs indeed...</p>

      <p>This website, of course, will be no exception!!! </p>

      <p>It is my own attempt to cram one more self-congratulatory bio page into the Internet's already bloated warehouse
      of contrived personal profiles.  So feel free to look around at this site's <em>vast</em> array of content.
      There are literally dozens of lines worth of information!</p>

      <p>Why You Should Hire Me</p>
    </div>

    <div class="intro">
    <p>Over the last several years, I have worked as an engineer/developer for a small software company.
    During this time, I learned how to program in several languages, for an array of applications
    (see the <a href="{% url 'mainapp:list' %}">About Me</a> section for more details).
    This relatively (extremely) modest website was built by me from the ground up, with an assist from Bootstrap,
    using as many relevant aspects of Full Stack Development as possible.  A link to this site's
    the source code, stored on GitHub, can be found <a href="{% url 'mainapp:documents' %}">here</a>.
    About the only thing I couldn't find a great use for on this particular site was jQuery/Javascript,
    so as an excuse to use them both, I created the random "Inspirational Quote Generator" you can see below.  Enjoy!</p>
